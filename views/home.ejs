			<h1>No Trust</h1>
			<p> Morsy is a messenger with the aim to avoid the need for trust. Morsy achieves this to a great extent by being peer to peer which ensures that the messages never pass through our servers. </p>

			<h1>Peer to Peer</h1>
			<p>Morsy uses peer to peer technology as its backend this means that all messages directly go from your device to the recipients device without passing through any of our servers. This ensures that even with subpoena from a government agency we wouldnt be able to hand over any of your messages.</p>
